Build solution in any way:
  A) dotnet build --configuration Release
  B) open and build solution with an IDE

This will build the project and move all needed files to bin folder.

To move these files to sample project, navigate to samples/Basic and run InstalCompilerNotBundled.bat

To debug project from samples/Basic in Rider,
open IncrementalCompiler solution, create new run configuration with these program arguments:
-dev C:/work/unity/Unity3D.IncrementalCompiler/samples/Basic <UnityTempFile>
<UnityTempFile> is generated by unity when compiler is ran to samples/Basic/Temp directory
